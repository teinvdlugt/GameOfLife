# GameOfLife
This is an Android app implementation of Game Of Life, a cellular automaton devised by John Conway in 1970.

One of the features of the app is that you can download a pattern from a database of 684 patterns. 
(However, as of February 2016, I haven't released this feature to the Play Store yet.)
I got these patterns from [LifeWiki](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page).
